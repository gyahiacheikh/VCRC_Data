1. Introduction & Objectives

Define the problem, dataset, and goals, now including:
	•	Unsupervised clustering with K-Means
	•	Dimensionality reduction with PCA
	•	Supervised classification with KNN
	•	Personalized suggestions using a Recommender System

⸻

2. Data Loading & Initial Overview

Load and explore the dataset, checking distributions and preparing it for both supervised and unsupervised learning.

⸻

3. Merging Geographic Coordinates

Join coordinates for spatial context; needed especially if visualization or recommender output includes geographic considerations.

⸻

4. Geographic Visualization

Map crime rates by region (optional enhancement for your recommender or PCA insights).

⸻

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand trends and correlations before applying ML:
	•	Visualize features for clustering (K-Means)
	•	Check class separability (for KNN)
	•	Identify dominant features (for PCA)

⸻

6. Predicting Missing Values

Ensure no key features are missing before feeding data into models like KNN, PCA, or K-Means.

⸻

7. Modeling Crime Rates

This section now expands into sub-parts:
	•	7.1 PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
	•	Reduce dimensionality
	•	Visualize principal components
	•	Feed into clustering or KNN
	•	7.2 K-Means Clustering
	•	Cluster counties or time periods
	•	Visualize clusters and interpret groupings
	•	7.3 KNN Classification
	•	Predict a label (e.g., crime level: high/low)
	•	Evaluate accuracy
	•	7.4 Recommender System
	•	Suggest similar counties or periods based on crime profile
	•	Use content-based or nearest-neighbor logic

⸻

8. Summary of Findings

Summarize key results from PCA, clustering, classification, and recommendation outputs.

⸻

9. Conclusion & Future Work

Reflect on the strengths and limits of the ML techniques used, and suggest further directions (e.g., time-series forecasting, deeper recommender models).

10. Appendix (Optional)

Backup plots, full K values tested for K-Means, hyperparameter settings, helper functions, etc.
