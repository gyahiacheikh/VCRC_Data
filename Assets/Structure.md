1. Introduction & Objectives
	•	Why: Set the stage. Define the problem, dataset, and goals.
	•	Include: A short markdown section introducing:
	•	The dataset (source: U.S. Open Data, timeframe: 2000–2013)
	•	Key goals:
	•	Analyze violent crime patterns
	•	Visualize crime spatially
	•	Explore correlation with population and GDP
	•	Build a predictive model
	•	Coding Part: None
	•	Why It’s Useful: Establishes motivation and scope for the entire analysis.

⸻

2. Data Loading & Initial Overview
	•	Why: Ensure the data is readable, structured, and ready for analysis.
	•	Include:
	•	Load dataset with pandas.read_csv()
	•	Display .head(), .info(), .describe()
	•	Basic inspection of distributions and missing data
	•	Coding Part:
	•	Basic data loading and exploration with pandas
	•	Why It’s Useful: Verifies that the data is complete, well-formed, and sets up expectations for deeper analysis.

⸻

3. Merging Geographic Coordinates
	•	Why: Map visualization requires latitude and longitude per county.
	•	Include:
	•	Load separate coordinate data
	•	Merge using county_name or FIPS code
	•	Check for nulls after merging (.isnull().sum())
	•	Coding Part:
	•	Use merge() in pandas
	•	Quality checks on the result
	•	Why It’s Useful: Ensures that every region can be placed correctly on a map for later spatial analysis.

⸻

4. Geographic Visualization
	•	Why: Mapping reveals spatial patterns in crime that raw numbers can’t.
	•	Include:
	•	Use folium or geopandas to map crime rates
	•	CircleMarker or Choropleth map based on violent crime rate
	•	Coding Part:
	•	folium.Map(), .CircleMarker(), or Choropleth
	•	Why It’s Useful: Helps identify regional crime hotspots and disparities across California.

⸻

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Why: To extract initial insights and guide further modeling.
	•	Include:
	•	Line plots of crime over time
	•	Histograms or boxplots of crime types
	•	Heatmap or scatterplot matrix to show correlations (e.g., rate vs GDP/population)
	•	Coding Part:
	•	Use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly
	•	Use .groupby() and .plot() for trends
	•	Why It’s Useful: Highlights relationships, outliers, and patterns worth modeling or investigating further.

⸻

6. Predicting Missing Values
	•	Why: Models require complete data; filling gaps improves reliability.
	•	Include:
	•	Locate missing values (.isnull().sum())
	•	Choose strategy (e.g., fill with median, interpolate, or model-based predictions)
	•	Justify choice
	•	Coding Part:
	•	.fillna(), .interpolate(), or train a regression model to predict missing entries
	•	Why It’s Useful: Strengthens the dataset so all observations are usable for visualization and modeling.

⸻

7. Modeling Crime Rates
	•	Why: To explore whether variables like GDP and population can predict crime rates.
	•	Include:
	•	Select features
	•	Optional scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
	•	Train-test split (train_test_split)
	•	Fit linear regression (or more advanced models)
	•	Evaluate with metrics like R², RMSE
	•	Coding Part:
	•	Use scikit-learn or statsmodels
	•	Include model fitting and performance evaluation
	•	Why It’s Useful: Enables forecasting and supports data-driven decisions by identifying drivers of crime.

⸻

8. Summary of Findings
	•	Why: Translate analysis into human-readable insights.
	•	Include:
	•	Markdown text summarizing major takeaways
	•	Examples:
	•	“Urban counties had higher absolute crime but lower per-capita rates.”
	•	“GDP negatively correlated with violent crime.”
	•	Coding Part: None
	•	Why It’s Useful: Synthesizes technical results into actionable conclusions for stakeholders or readers.

⸻

9. Conclusion & Future Work
	•	Why: Reflect on challenges and open the door for extensions.
	•	Include:
	•	Brief discussion on what worked and what didn’t
	•	Limitations (e.g., outdated data, lack of demographic controls)
	•	Suggestions:
	•	Use education, employment data
	•	Extend to 2024 if data allows
	•	Coding Part: None
	•	Why It’s Useful: Shows awareness of project scope and encourages iteration or reuse by others.

⸻

10. Appendix (Optional)
	•	Why: Keep the notebook clean while storing helpful extras.
	•	Include:
	•	Data dictionaries
	•	Source links
	•	Helper functions or backup plots
	•	Coding Part:
	•	Utility scripts, full correlation matrix, extended visualizations
	•	Why It’s Useful: Supports reproducibility and keeps clutter out of the main report.
